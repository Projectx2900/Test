\f0\b Product Description:
\f1\b0 \'a0An app that makes finding a suitable car for an average user simple and straightforward. Instead of needing to have knowledge about car makes, models, and so on, urCar uses simple terms and categories to understand what the user is looking for in a car. For example, the app would ask the user what uses they need for the car, how much their willing to spend, where they are located to understand the climate of that area, and what features are essential to the user. With this information, the app will be able to return a select range of vehicles that can tend to the needs of the user.}
